      * Recap:
      * 1. Sources generate values.
      * 2. Sinks consume values.
      * 3. Materialization is the process of running the Stream, and getting your Sink to do something.
      * 4. Flows are linear transformations.
      * 5. Graphs can be modelled with Broadcast (and Merge, but we didnâ€™t try them out).
